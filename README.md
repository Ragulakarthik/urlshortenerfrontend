# URL Shortener API 🌐

## Overview 📖

The URL Shortener API is a Java-based Spring Boot application integrated with a React front end, allowing users to shorten long URLs, set expiration dates, update existing URLs, and redirect to original URLs. It uses a MySQL database for persistence and stores URL mappings, with functionality to handle URL expiration. The entire application is containerized using Docker for simplified deployment and scalability, ensuring consistent environments for both the Spring Boot API and MySQL database, making it efficient and practical for real-world use.
